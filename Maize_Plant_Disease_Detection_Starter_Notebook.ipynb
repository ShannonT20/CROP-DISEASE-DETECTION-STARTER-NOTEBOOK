    "### About the Challenge\n",
    "Maize is the staple crop that sustains millions of Zimbabweans, underpinning both food security and livelihoods across rural and urban communities. Yet, Zimbabwe‚Äôs maize production is persistently threatened by several devastating leaf diseases‚Äîprimarily **Common Rust**, **Gray Leaf Spot**, and **Blight**‚Äîwhich cause significant yield reductions and economic losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "These diseases are widespread across Zimbabwe‚Äôs diverse agro-ecological zones, including:\n",
    "- High-rainfall areas like **Mashonaland East** and **Manicaland**.\n",
    "- Drier regions like **Masvingo**.\n",
    "- The central **Midlands**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their impact is exacerbated by limited access to timely and accurate disease diagnostics, especially for smallholder farmers who form the backbone of Zimbabwe‚Äôs agriculture.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task\n",
    "Develop **deep learning models** that can accurately detect and classify maize diseases from leaf images. Leveraging AI for early and precise disease identification can transform farming practices by:\n",
    "- Providing farmers with **real-time, accessible tools** to identify diseases before they spread widely.\n",
    "- Reducing reliance on **manual inspection**, which is often subjective and slow.\n",
    "- Enabling **targeted interventions** to minimize crop loss and reduce pesticide overuse.\n",
    "- Contributing to **improved food security** and agricultural sustainability in Zimbabwe.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "The dataset includes images of maize leaves categorized into:\n",
    "1. **Common Rust**\n",
    "2. **Gray Leaf Spot**\n",
    "3. **Blight**\n",
    "4. **Healthy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Your challenge is to design and train models robust to diverse field conditions (e.g., varying lighting, leaf angles, and disease severity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact\n",
    "By addressing this challenge, you will contribute to a **high-impact solution** with direct applications in Zimbabwe‚Äôs farming communities and beyond, driving the adoption of AI-powered precision agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
